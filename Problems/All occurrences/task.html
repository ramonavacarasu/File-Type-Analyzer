  <p>Given two strings, a pattern and a text. Write a program that counts the number of times the pattern occurs in the text and prints indexes of all occurrences.</p> 
  <p><strong>Input: </strong>two strings, a pattern and a text, each is on a separate line. It is guaranteed that the length of the text is always greater than $0$.</p> 
  <p><strong>Output: </strong>the first line should contain the number of times the pattern occurs in the text. The second line should contain all indexes of occurrences separated by space.</p> 
  <p>Keep in mind that the empty string is a substring for any string. See the second test case as an example of how an empty pattern should be processed.</p>
