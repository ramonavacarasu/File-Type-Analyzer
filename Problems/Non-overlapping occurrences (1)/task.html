  <p>Write a program that finds all non-overlapping occurrences of a pattern in a text.</p> 
  <p><strong>Input:</strong> two strings, a pattern <span class="math-tex">\( p \)</span> and a text <span class="math-tex">\( t \)</span>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Output: </strong>the first line should contain the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the pattern in the text. The second line should contain the index of these occurrences separated by space.</p> 
  <p>For two overlapping substrings, consider as occurrence the one that has the least starting index. (it is supposed that a searching starts from the beginning of the text).</p>
